# DKE Online MP3 Player

This program is an online mp3 player of Delta Kappa Epsilon 12 songs recorded in 1959. The program is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>

The howler.js library is used, which can be found here: https://howlerjs.com/.<br>
I have taken the code from *player* folder under *examples*, found [here](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/tree/master/examples/player), then modified things
to my needs. <br> The only file not change is howler.core.js, can be found [here](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/tree/master/src).
